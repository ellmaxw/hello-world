# hello-world
This is my first repository, created using the Hello World tutorial provided by Github. (2022)
I am a senior majoring in **Business Analytics** in the *IT, Analytics and Operations* department at the University of Notre Dame. You can find me on LinkedIn [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabeth-ellie-maxwell-a464b2174/). 
I am excited to learn more about using version control for current academic and future professional projects. Feel free to explore my page!
